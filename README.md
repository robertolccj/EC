# Electronics Circuits LaTeX Model #

This model was adapted from the IEEE Congress LaTeX model, that was adapted by INSPER to its own institute and available in Overleaf website, by Allan CÃ©sar Marques Lira [https://github.com/acmlira] to be a good model for laboratory reports of Electronics Circuits 1, UNIFOR's CCT discipline. In addition, there is no financial end and code has comments in portuguese.
